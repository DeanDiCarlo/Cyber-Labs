# Cyber Labs Portfolio

This repository is a day by day cybersecurity lab portfolio built to practice practical, industry relevant skills and produce interview ready documentation.

## Ethics and Scope
All work in this repository is performed only in legal lab environments, including local VMs, Docker labs, or authorized training platforms. I do not test real world systems without explicit permission. Any evidence uploaded is sanitized to avoid secrets, tokens, and identifying data.

## Repo Goals

- Build consistent daily security lab practice
- Produce **interview-ready writeups**
- Capture evidence artifacts (commands, outputs, findings)
- Create a clean portfolio that demonstrates:
  - methodology
  - technical depth
  - communication ability

## Progress Tracker (12 Days)

> Each day has a dedicated folder with a README writeup and artifacts.

- [x] **Day 01 — Network Recon with Nmap**
- [ ] **Day 02 — Packet Analysis with Wireshark**
- [ ] **Day 03 — Linux Log Triage (SSH auth + suspicious activity)**
- [ ] **Day 04 — Burp Suite Basics (Proxy + Repeater + basic intercepts)**
- [ ] **Day 05 — SQL Injection Fundamentals**
- [ ] **Day 06 — XSS (Stored vs Reflected)**
- [ ] **Day 07 — IDOR / Broken Access Control**
- [ ] **Day 08 — Blue Team Detection + Triage Day**
- [ ] **Day 09 — Directory Traversal**
- [ ] **Day 10 — Authentication Bypass / Session Logic**
- [ ] **Day 11 — Nmap Vuln Scanning + Targeted NSE**
- [ ] **Day 12 — Incident Timeline + Reporting Capstone Writeup**
