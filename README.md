# Cyber Labs Portfolio

This repository is a day by day cybersecurity lab portfolio built to practice practical, industry relevant skills and produce interview ready documentation.


## Ethics and Scope
All work in this repository is performed only in legal lab environments, including local VMs, Docker labs, or authorized training platforms. I do not test real world systems without explicit permission. Any evidence uploaded is sanitized to avoid secrets, tokens, and identifying data.


## Repo Goals

- Build consistent daily security lab practice
- Capture evidence artifacts (commands, outputs, findings)
- Create a clean portfolio that demonstrates:
  - methodology
  - technical depth
  - communication ability


## Progress Tracker (12 Labs)

> Each day has a dedicated folder with a README writeup and artifacts.

- [x] **Day 01 — [`Network Recon with Nmap**`](writeups/01-network-recon-nmap/)
- [x] **Day 02 — [`Packet Analysis with Wireshark**`](writeups/02-wireshark-http-analysis/)
- [ ] **Day 03 — [`Linux Log Triage (SSH auth + suspicious activity)**`](writeups/03-linux-log-analysis-ssh/)
- [x] **Day 04 — [`Burp Suite Basics (Proxy + Repeater + basic intercepts)**`](writeups/04-burp-suite-basics/)
- [x] **Day 05 — [`SQL Injection Fundamentals**`](writeups/05-sqli-fundamentals/)
- [ ] **Day 06 — [`XSS (Stored vs Reflected)**`](writeups/06-xss-stored-reflected/)
- [ ] **Day 07 — [`IDOR / Broken Access Control**`](writeups/07-idor-access-control/)
- [ ] **Day 08 — [`Blue Team Detection + Triage Day**`](writeups/08-blue-team-detection-triage/)
- [ ] **Day 09 — [`Directory Traversal**`](writeups/09-directory-traversal/)
- [ ] **Day 10 — [`Authentication Bypass / Session Logic**`](writeups/10-authentication-bypass/)
- [ ] **Day 11 — [`Nmap Vuln Scanning + Targeted NSE**`](writeups/11-nmap-vuln-scanning/)
- [ ] **Day 12 — [`Incident Timeline + Reporting Capstone Writeup**`](writeups/12-incident-timeline-analysis/)
