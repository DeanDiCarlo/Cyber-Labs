# Cyber Labs Portfolio

This repository is a cybersecurity lab portfolio built to practice practical, industry relevant skills and produce interview ready documentation.


## Ethics and Scope
All work in this repository is performed only in legal lab environments, including local VMs, Docker labs, or authorized training platforms. I do not test real world systems without explicit permission. Any evidence uploaded is sanitized to avoid secrets, tokens, and identifying data.


## Repo Goals

- Build consistent daily security lab practice
- Capture evidence artifacts (commands, outputs, findings)
- Create a clean portfolio that demonstrates:
  - methodology
  - technical depth
  - communication ability


## Progress Tracker (12 Labs)

> Each day has a dedicated folder with a README writeup and artifacts.

- [x] **Day 01 — [`Network Recon with Nmap`](writeups/01-network-recon-nmap/)**
- [x] **Day 02 — [`Packet Analysis with Wireshark`](writeups/02-wireshark-http-analysis/)**
- [x] **Day 03 — [`Burp Suite Basics (Proxy + Repeater + basic intercepts)`](writeups/03-burp-suite-basics/)**
- [x] **Day 04 — [`SQL Injection Fundamentals`](writeups/04-sqli-fundamentals/)**
- [x] **Day 05 — [`XSS (Stored vs Reflected)`](writeups/05-xss-stored-reflected/)**
- [x] **Day 06 — [`IDOR / Broken Access Control`](writeups/06-idor-access-control/)**
- [ ] **Day 07 — [`Directory Traversal`](writeups/07-directory-traversal/)**
- [ ] **Day 08 — [`Authentication Bypass / Session Logic`](writeups/08-authentication-bypass/)**
- [ ] **Day 09 — [`BTJA Fundamentals: Blue Team Mindset + Detection Concepts`](writeups/09-btja-fundamentals/)**
- [ ] **Day 10 — [`BTJA Log Sources & Event Analysis`](writeups/10-btja-log-sources/)**
- [ ] **Day 11 — [`BTJA Alert Triage & Incident Analysis`](writeups/11-btja-alert-triage/)**
- [ ] **Day 12 — [`BTJA Incident Reporting Capstone`](writeups/12-btja-incident-report/)**
