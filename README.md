# Cyber Labs Portfolio

This repository is a day by day cybersecurity lab portfolio built to practice practical, industry relevant skills and produce interview ready documentation.

## Ethics and Scope
All work in this repository is performed only in legal lab environments, including local VMs, Docker labs, or authorized training platforms. I do not test real world systems without explicit permission. Any evidence uploaded is sanitized to avoid secrets, tokens, and identifying data.

## Repo Structure
- `writeups/` contains one folder per day with a consistent format:
  - `README.md` writeup
  - `screenshots/` visual evidence
  - `artifacts/` sanitized tool output and supporting files
- `resources/` contains setup notes and quick references
- `scripts/` contains workflow notes for sanitization and organization
