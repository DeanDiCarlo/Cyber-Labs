LAN segment range: 10.1.17.0/24 (10.1.17.0 through 10.1.17.255)
Domain: bluemoontuesday.com
AD environment name: BLUEMOONTUESDAY
Domain Controller: 10.1.17.2 – WIN-GSH54QLW48D
LAN segment gateway: 10.1.17.1
LAN segment broadcast address: 10.1.17.255

BACKGROUND:
You work as an analyst at a Security Operation Center (SOC). Someone contacts your
team to report a coworker has downloaded a suspicious file after searching for Google
Authenticator. The caller provides some information similar to social media posts at:
• https://www.linkedin.com/posts/unit42_2025-01-22-wednesday-a-malicious-adled-activity-7288213662329192450-ky3V/
• https://x.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1882448037030584611
Based on the caller's initial information, you confirm there was an infection. You retrieve a
pcap of the associated traffic. Reviewing the traffic, you find several indicators matching
details from a Github page referenced in the above social media posts. After confirming an
infection happened, you begin writing an incident report.

TASK:
For this exercise, answer the following questions for your incident report:
•
•
•
•
•
•

What is the IP address of the infected Windows client?
What is the mac address of the infected Windows client?
What is the host name of the infected Windows client?
What is the user account name from the infected Windows client?
What is the likely domain name for the fake Google Authenticator page?
What are the IP addresses used for C2 servers for this infection?

Host name: DESKTOP-L8C5GSJ
MAC address: 00:d0:b7:26:4a:74

Probable fake software site for initial malware download:
• authenticatoor.org

Shown above: traffic showing the redirect domain and the final software download page.

IP addresses used for C2 traffic:
• 5.252.153.241
• 45.125.66.32
• 45.125.66.252
More details on the post infection traffic are at:
• https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/202501-22-IOCs-for-malware-from-fake-Microsoft-Teams-site.txt
The infection documented in the above Github page is from a different fake software
site, and the post-infection check-in URLs have a different number because this is a
different infected Windows host. Otherwise, all of the post-infection traffic is the same.
That Github page also has file SHA256 hashes for files sent during the infection that
you can export from the pcap. This is also information you could add to an incident
report.
I’m not sure what this malware is called, but it’s clearly malicious.
